CODTECH Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking Internship

This repository contains the solutions for the CODTECH-IT Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking Internship tasks. The internship focused on practical cybersecurity and ethical hacking skills through hands-on tool development using Python.

Internship Tasks
Task 1: File Integrity Checker
Objective: Monitor file changes by calculating and comparing hash values.
Implementation: Built a Python script using hashlib to generate file hashes (e.g., MD5, SHA-256) and verify integrity.
Use Case: Detects unauthorized file modifications, ensuring data security.

Task 2: Web Application Vulnerability Scanner
Objective: Identify common vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
Implementation: Developed a Python-based scanner using requests and BeautifulSoup.
Use Case: Helps assess basic security flaws in web applications.

Task 3: Penetration Testing Toolkit
Objective: Build a modular toolkit with multiple cybersecurity tools.
Modules Included:
Port Scanner
Brute-Force Tool
Basic Reconnaissance Utility
Implementation: Designed in Python with modular architecture and detailed documentation.
Use Case: Assists ethical hackers in testing and strengthening system security.

Task 4: Advanced Encryption Tool
Objective: Encrypt and decrypt files using modern algorithms.
Implementation: Created a robust Python application using AES-256 encryption, with a simple user interface.
Use Case: Protects sensitive data from unauthorized access.
