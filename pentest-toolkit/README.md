Pentest Toolkit

A lightweight Python toolkit with two basic pentesting tools:

Port Scanner: Fast threaded TCP port scanner.
HTTP Basic Auth Brute Force: Demonstration of HTTP Basic Authentication brute force (for authorized testing only).

Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
requests library (pip install requests)

Usage:

Port Scanner
Scan ports on a target host:
python pentest_toolkit.py ports --host 127.0.0.1 --start 1 --end 1024

HTTP Basic Auth Brute Force
Try passwords from a wordlist against a URL requiring HTTP Basic Auth:
python pentest_toolkit.py http-brute --url http://localhost:8000/protected --wordlist passwords.txt

Disclaimer
Only use these tools on systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized scanning or brute forcing is illegal and unethical.
